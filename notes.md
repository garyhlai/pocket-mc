Notes on interfaces for writing quick and dirty freestyle:
1. pick the beat first - (encouraging a particular rap writing style - writing lyrics to the beat)
2. make an interface that encourages writing sick lyrics.

Other notes:
- we will need to engineer African American English (AAE) specific NLP solutions.
- we should provide interesting/helpful relevant youtube videos on the side (monetize?)
